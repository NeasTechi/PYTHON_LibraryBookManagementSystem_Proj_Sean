# PYTHON_LibraryBookManagementSystem_Proj_Sean
To demonstrate real-world Stack and Queue operations in a practical library management application

📚 Library Book Management System
🎯 Project Overview
A Python GUI application that demonstrates Stack and Queue data structures through a real-world library management system. This interactive program visually shows how LIFO (Stack) and FIFO (Queue) operations work in practical scenarios.

⚡ Features
🔥 Core Operations
Stack Operations (LIFO - Last In First Out)

Push - Add returned books to recent returns stack

Pop - Remove from recent returns

Display - Show recently returned books

Queue Operations (FIFO - First In First Out)

Enqueue - Add members to waiting list

Dequeue - Process next member in waiting list

Display - Show current waiting queue

📖 Library Functions
Book Borrowing - Check out available books

Book Returning - Process returns (automatically adds to stack)

Waiting List Management - Fair queue system for popular books

Real-time Inventory Tracking - Monitor book availability

🎨 User Interface
Interactive GUI built with Tkinter

Visual Stack Display - Recently returned books

Visual Queue Display - Waiting list members

Real-time Updates - Instant visual feedback

Pre-loaded Data - Sample books and members

🛠️ Technology Stack
Language: Python 3.x

GUI Framework: Tkinter

Dictionaries
available_books - Book inventory with copy counts

members - Pre-registered library members

borrowed_books - Currently loaned books tracking
📊 Sample Data
